10.18.18

At this point in the project I have downloaded two FASTQ files which I will attempt to work with.

The needed programs have been successfully installed and include PEAR, cutadapt, usearch, grep, and awk.


10.25.18

The two FASTQ files have been merged into one assemble read in the form of another FASTQ file. Some quality control was done and a max read length of 350 was added.
